# Sorting Algorithms

This python project was my final project for my Discrete Mathematics in Computing class. I chose to implement sorting algorithms and then run it against 
a test case. 

I implemented the following sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Tim Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
